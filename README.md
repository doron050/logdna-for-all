## Setup for Development

In order to contribute you will need the following accounts :bookmark::
* <a href="https://www.zeit.co/">Zeit</a>
* <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Cloud</a>
* <a href="https://logdna.com/">LogDNA</a>

#### Get our code ####

```bash 
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/doron050/logdna-for-all.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd logdna-for-all

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

#### Zeit integrations ####
* Follow the instarations on <a href="https://zeit.co/docs/integrations/">Zeit Integration documentation</a> in order to setup your integration
* On your integration settings page:
  * Leave the redirect url empty
  * Set the ui-hooks url to: http://localhost:5005/ui-hooks
* Go to your integration page and add it to your user/team
* Add your logDNA token :key:

#### MongoDB cloud ####
* Register to mongo db cloud
* Create your cluster and get the connection details :bookmark_tabs:
* Make sure you set your `.env` file :pencil2:: 
```diff
# DB
+ DB_USER_NAME=[your mongodb cloud user name]
+ DB_PASSWORD=[your mongodb cloud password]
+ DB_URL=[your mongodb url]
+ DB_SCHEME=[your mongodb scheme]
+ DB_NAME=[your mongodb db name]
+ DB_COLLECTION_NAME=[your mongodb collection name]
```
#### Advanced .env ####
You shoul'd tell what is your environment:
```diff
# ENV
+ ENVIRONMENT=[producation / development]
```
If you want to, you can control some of our intervals :clock1::
```diff
+ CONSUME_PROJECT_LOG_INTERVAL=[time between reading and sending logs - default is 3000]
+ SYNC_SUBSCRIBER_WITH_DB_INTERVAL=[time between sync with the metadata inside the db - default is 6000]
```
If you want your integration to send the logs to [LogzIO]() you need to set this one also:
```diff
# LOGGER
+ LOGGER_TOKEN=[LogzIO token]
```

#### Run the integration ####
* Run your integration locally using `npm run zeit`
* Use you browser and go to your integration configuration page :scroll:
* You now should see the integration configuration page _(it is connected to your localhost)_

_**:warning:notice!**_
> If you want to debug and change the configuration UI you are good to go!
> Every configuration you create will be saved inside your db. You use this data in the following background node app.

#### Run your background node app ####

_**:warning:notice!**_
> Since we can't use our localhost as the redirect endpoint for the oauth proccess<br/>you will miss 2 critical fields on every db document (ZeitToken, teamId) :sweat:

In order to get over it :muscle:: 
* Upload your app to zeit using `now` command (you already got our now.json) :outbox_tray:
* Set your integration with the redirect url redirect to `<zeit-host-name>/redirect`
* Set the following `secret`s :closed_lock_with_key:: 
```diff
# Zeit 
+ INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID=[Your app auth client id]
+ INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET=[Your app secret]
```
* Now you have to follow <a href="#How-to-Use">How to Use</a> steps in order to use your integration :sweat_smile:

_**Now you can run the background node!**_
* Use `npm start` in order to start the sync

Have fun. Keep Coding. :computer:
